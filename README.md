Tools and Techniques
- Power BI Designed and built dashboards using visualizations such as line charts, donut charts, and KPIs.
- DAX Created calculated measures, including Total Profit, Profit Margin, and Return Rate.
- Time Intelligence Used DAX functions like DATESYTD and TOTALYTD to analyze trends over time.

The Bikes category generates the highest share of profit, followed by Accessories and Clothing.
Returning customers play a key role in maintaining revenue.
The overall return rate is low (2.17%), reflecting high customer satisfaction.
